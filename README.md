Welcome to Eternal Genesis, an advanced visualizer for Conway's Game of Life. This is not just a mere implementation of the renowned cellular automaton discovered by John Horton Conway, but it is an artistic exploration of life, visualizing the complex and beautiful patterns that emerge from simple rules.

In this project, we explore various expressions such as:
 
- **Color based on cell age:** Cells are colored based on their age, creating a vibrant and visually interesting display.
- **Gradient color based on neighbor count:** Cell color changes based on the number of its alive neighbors, highlighting the density of life around each cell.
- **Heatmap:** Cells are colored based on how often they've been alive, revealing hotspots of activity over time.
- **Cellular Trail:** A faint trail is left where cells have died, providing a visual history of cell activity.
- **Different Shapes for Cells:** Cells are drawn in various shapes, from circles and triangles to more complex forms.
- **3D Visualization:** Experience Conway's Game of Life in a new dimension with our 3D grid visualization.
- **Incorporate Sound:** Auditory elements are added, with sounds playing based on certain events in the Game of Life, creating an immersive audiovisual experience.
- **Interactive Manipulation:** Users can interact with the game, with the ability to create and manipulate cell patterns.
